<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of security. The device permits water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are 2 various types of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are frequently defined-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device.

<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
