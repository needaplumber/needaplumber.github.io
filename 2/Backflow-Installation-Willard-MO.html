<p>Tank to Tankless installation: If you're switching from a water tank to a tankless style, the installation procedure takes a bit longer. Additional time is required to install brand-new power and water lines and air vents. Later, the tankless unit needs to also be mounted and linked.

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Willard MO</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
