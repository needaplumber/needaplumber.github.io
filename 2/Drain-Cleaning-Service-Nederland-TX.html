<p>There are lots of elements to a toilet that work together to make it operate. There might be a concern with the handle or the lift arm if it is not flushing effectively. It might also be the flush lever or the flapper. An experienced technician would have the ability to identify which part is stopping working to make the toilet repair right away. Is your water heater dispensing cold instead of hot water? Yikes! It might be something as basic as a blown pilot burner or as complicated as a faulty thermocouple. Relighting the pilot light might be a Do It Yourself task. Changing the thermocouple or fixing is a task for our group of proficient pros.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
