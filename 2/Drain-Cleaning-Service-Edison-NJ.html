<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing business. Determine the size of the pipes in the house and around the house - they will help to figure out the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the house. The pipes themselves must be at least a 1/2" in size to offer sufficient circulation.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- essentially two layers of protection. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, but closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect method. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on an accreditation test, I mention them just.</p>
