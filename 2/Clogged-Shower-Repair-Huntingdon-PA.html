<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>If the water feels warm, then the heating aspect is taking longer to heat up the water than it should. But this specific issue is when you have no hot water streaming in your house. The reasons for this can range from leakages, defective or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is one of the pointed out issues, a repair or replacement of the elements may be enough. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening frequently, then a water heater replacement is essential.</p>
