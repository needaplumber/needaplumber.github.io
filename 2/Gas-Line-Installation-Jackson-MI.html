<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
