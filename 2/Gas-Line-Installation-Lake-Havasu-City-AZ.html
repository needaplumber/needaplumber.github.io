<p>When you drop something down your drain or when you clean out a couple of hairs from the tub, it may seem like just a small problem.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
