<p>The majority of property owners have conventional hot water heater that come with a tank where hot water is saved. While these are cost-effective in the beginning buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable method for you to receive hot water, particularly if your unit is dated. If your hot water heater is more than 8 years old, it might be time to think about changing it with a new energy-efficient model. That's where the plumbers at Casteel comes in.</p>
