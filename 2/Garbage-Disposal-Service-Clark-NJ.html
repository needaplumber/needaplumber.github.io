It is important that you have reliable plumbing components in the kitchen considering it is one of the busiest rooms; from washing dishes to cleaning foods, the kitchen sink is crucial.

PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and was in broad usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII.

<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be treated quickly if the clog is easy and shallow. For a lot of clogs you'll simply need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this does not solve the problem then you might also need to hire a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also harder to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
