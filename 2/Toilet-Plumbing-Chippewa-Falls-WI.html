<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Chippewa Falls WI</h3>
<p>We're changing a gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The actions for replacing a gas water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electric hot water heater are similar. Recurring repairs and leakages. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run.
