<p>Discover the best water softener for you. One typical way for a home's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
