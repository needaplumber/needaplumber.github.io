<p>Discover the best water softener for you. One typical way for a home's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread exponentially if that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
