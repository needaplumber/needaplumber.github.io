<h3>Leaking Pipes Repair in East Falmouth Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in areas where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
