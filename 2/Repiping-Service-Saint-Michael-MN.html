<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does happen regularly than you believe! When you do not observe the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

When this happens, plumbers and house owners need to have the ability to clean out their drainage pipes. Structures without sufficient cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at threat of a pipe bursting.</p>
