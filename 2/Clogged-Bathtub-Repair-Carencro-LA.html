<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground seamless gutter drains terminate in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your backyard. Because case, procedure from the downspout to the nearest manhole, and use an auger line a minimum of that long to ensure you're cleaning the entire pipe.

Initially, these little deposits are safe, but gradually they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
