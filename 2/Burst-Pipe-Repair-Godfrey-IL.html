Waste disposal unit blockages can be caused by food items like fats or grease, bones, or highly fibrous foods like celery.</p>
<p>DCVs are specifically designed to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for normal fire protection applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 separately running spring-loaded check valves (normally inside a single valve body), four test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals begin around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending on size, brand and features.</p>
