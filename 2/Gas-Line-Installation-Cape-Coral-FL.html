<p>The anode rod in your water heater is developed to attract corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from wearing away. The very best method to prevent drain clogs is to view what you flush.

Rusting pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they have not currently) and must be replaced as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Hot water heater failures trigger millions of dollars in water damages every year. Remember that when choosing your new commercial hot water heater, you get what you pay for.
