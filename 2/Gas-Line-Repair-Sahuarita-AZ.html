<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>In truth, reverse flow testing designed to ensure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health concern, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are properly checked by certified workers.</p>
