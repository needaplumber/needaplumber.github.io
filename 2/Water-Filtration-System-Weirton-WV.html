<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Weirton WV</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing interruption service might seem like a waste of money. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick? While chemical drain cleaners might be an affordable option, the extreme ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, gradually, developing weak spots in the pipe that are most likely to burst. Handling fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, particularly when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
