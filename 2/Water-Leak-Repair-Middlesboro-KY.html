Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey alternative.</p>
