<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly required, sometimes the plumber may need to upgrade or repair electrical wiring to power the brand-new garbage disposal. This usually costs an extra $50 to $100+.

Contact our professionals to figure out the degree of the problem.</p>
