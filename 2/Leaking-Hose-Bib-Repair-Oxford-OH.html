For the valve to work appropriately, the discharge pipe must be kept free of obstructions (Fig. A).</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
