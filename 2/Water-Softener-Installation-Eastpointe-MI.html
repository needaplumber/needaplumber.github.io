<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Normally, the supply of water to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>Longstanding Blockages: Obstructions that continue after you've attempted to repair them call for professional support. Continued attempts by yourself can hurt your lines, and you may have a more serious underlying problem than you are aware of. In addition, the longer you delay to call for professional support, the greater the likelihood that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
