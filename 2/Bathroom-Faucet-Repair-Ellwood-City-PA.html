<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the house. Usually, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.
