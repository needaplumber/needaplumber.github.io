<p>Changing your flapper might require slightly different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job.

Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.

Regeneration automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
