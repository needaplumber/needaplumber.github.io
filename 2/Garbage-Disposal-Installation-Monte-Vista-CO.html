<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your house? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While some of these issues can be attributed to regular wear and tear or improper installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit ends up being damaged by items that should not be gone through it.</p>
<p>When you have an issue with your toilet-- whether a clog that can't be repaired with simply a plunger, a leak, or a toilet that won't flush-- you need a plumber, quick.

<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Monte Vista CO</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
