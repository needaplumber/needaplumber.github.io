<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

This is a type of plastic resin that was extensively utilized by contractors for houses built in the 1970s through the 1990s. The problem with this type of plastic piping is it can become brittle and break easily, specifically if your water is chlorinated or chemically treated.</p>
<p>If further renovations are wanted, such as setting up a tankless water heater or expanding the water supply to accommodate a remodel, this is when those additional changes will be made. Lastly, the drywall and other materials will be repaired, patched, and retextured so that it looks like absolutely nothing ever occurred.
