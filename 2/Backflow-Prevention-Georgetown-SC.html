<p>They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, however I give the company props for contacting us to update us on the later arrival time. Some tasks take longer than anticipated, that's reasonable, by keeping us notified of the slight delay, we didn't need to worry. We contacted Ron Steele Plumbing to install new water supply and drain lines throughout our master bathroom renovating project. Not only were they extremely affordable, however the professional service and quality installation exceeded our expectations.</p>
