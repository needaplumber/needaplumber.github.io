<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and split or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or corroded that they spring a leak. We strongly advise likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

Maintenance needs are very little, however it does pay to have the system examined for correct operation routinely.</p>
