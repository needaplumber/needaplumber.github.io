<p>Last but not least, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
