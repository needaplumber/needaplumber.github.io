<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Dunkirk NY</h3>
<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
