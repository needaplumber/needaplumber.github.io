<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
