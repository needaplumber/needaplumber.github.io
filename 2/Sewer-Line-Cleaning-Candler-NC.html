<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does occur regularly than you think! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
