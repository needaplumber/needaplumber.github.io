<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Riverside IL</h3>
<p>A freshly set up water heater must not produce unusual sounds, however it will start to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things aggravate considerably for homes with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement may be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced.
