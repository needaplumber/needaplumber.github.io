<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Dry Ridge KY</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
