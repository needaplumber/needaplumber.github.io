<p>No other room in a home consists of as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned up and examined the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now prepared to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some models need the components to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each component is returned into the body, it is very important to put them back in the right place. It is likewise essential that as they are positioned back into the body, that no foreign matter is attached on the parts or inadvertently positioned in the body. The parts should be put so that the guides have the ability to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by hooking up a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain.
