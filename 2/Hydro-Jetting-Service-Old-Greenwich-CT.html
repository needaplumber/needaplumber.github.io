<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Old Greenwich CT 06870</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
