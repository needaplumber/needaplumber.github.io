The elements must be positioned so that the guides have the ability to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
