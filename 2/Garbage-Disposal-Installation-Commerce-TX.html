<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
