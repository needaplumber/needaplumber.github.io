<p>You may have heard stories about a hot water heater taking off inside a home or company!

A traditional tank water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last as much as 20 with correct maintenance and care.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be identified to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Raymond NH 03077</h3>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

<p>The concern of leak can be attributed to any variety of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank need to have some room to represent the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to escape, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force exerted by the expansion happening when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
