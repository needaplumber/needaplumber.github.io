<p>Once you've discovered the trip lever you desire, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct way.
