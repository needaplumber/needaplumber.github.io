<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.

The most popular and traditional style of water heaters in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electrical tank system.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
