<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the system falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
