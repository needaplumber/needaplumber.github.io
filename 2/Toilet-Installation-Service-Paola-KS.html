<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it might wreak undesirable issues on your property. A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
