<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
