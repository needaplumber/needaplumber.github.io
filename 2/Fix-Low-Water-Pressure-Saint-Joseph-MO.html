<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
