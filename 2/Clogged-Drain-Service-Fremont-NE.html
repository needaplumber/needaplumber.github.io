<p>This article aims to resolve the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive. Here are a couple of confusing realities that frequently lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a misconception due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
