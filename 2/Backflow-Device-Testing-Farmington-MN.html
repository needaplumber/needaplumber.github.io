<h3>Water Heater Repair Services at Farmington MN 55024</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
