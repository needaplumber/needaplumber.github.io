PVC pipe started to be made in the 1940s and was in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.
