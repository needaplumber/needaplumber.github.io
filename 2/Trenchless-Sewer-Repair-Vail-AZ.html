For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually sodium or often potassium).</p>
