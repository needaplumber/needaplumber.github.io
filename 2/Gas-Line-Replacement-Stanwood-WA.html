<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
