Here are a few confusing realities that typically lead people to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is normally destructive.

<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals.

Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
