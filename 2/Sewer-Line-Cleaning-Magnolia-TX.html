<p>Every sensible purchaser inspects a minimum of several things prior to making a deposit on a home. As you might know that the water quality here is pretty bad.

On top of that our average water hardness level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness reasons "really tough water".</p>
<p>Before choice and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature level varieties. All assemblies must be safeguarded from freezing temperatures and if installed where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly need to be utilized.
