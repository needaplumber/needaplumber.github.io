<p>Changing your flapper may require a little different actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but possibilities are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
