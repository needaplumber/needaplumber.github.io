<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have attained an advancement in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface area Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically removes momentary firmness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major constraints of existing softening innovations.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with.
