<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Henderson NV</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank.
