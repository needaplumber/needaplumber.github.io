For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may stream in reverse into the safe and clean water supply.
