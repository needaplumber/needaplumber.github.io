<p>You will be able to ask for the date and time of the inspection on the TSE authorization application. The LADBS application must be submitted and spent for a minimum of two (2) business days prior to the date of the occasion, AND, after you have actually acquired all other needed approvals or clearances from all other companies. Garbage disposals can be made of either aluminum or stainless-steel. Aluminum is cheaper but more vulnerable to leaking and corrosion. Stainless steel blades are also more durable. Individuals with a septic system will need to contact the septic system installer or manufacturer to find out which garbage disposal designs are compatible with their system.</p>
