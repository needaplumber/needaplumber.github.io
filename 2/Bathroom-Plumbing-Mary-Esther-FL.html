<p>Finally, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
