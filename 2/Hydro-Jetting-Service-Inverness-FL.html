However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.

<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
