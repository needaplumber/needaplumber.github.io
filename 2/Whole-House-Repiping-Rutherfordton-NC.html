<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
