Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based).

<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furnishings to secure them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will only eliminate as much structure material as essential to reach, remove, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. You can set up to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel if you want.</p>
