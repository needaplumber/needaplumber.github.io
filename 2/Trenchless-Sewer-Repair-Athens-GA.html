<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide.

If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
