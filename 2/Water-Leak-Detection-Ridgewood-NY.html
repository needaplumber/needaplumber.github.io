<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, however it does happen more often than you think! When you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
