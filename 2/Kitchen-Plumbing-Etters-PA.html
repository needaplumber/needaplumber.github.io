<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite.

The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
