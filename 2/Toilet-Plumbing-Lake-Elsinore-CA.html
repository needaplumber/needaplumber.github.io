<h3>How To Overcome Emergency Plumbing Issues Lake Elsinore CA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Toilet replacements and repairs are a natural part of being a property owner. You might sustain much more costly residential or commercial property damage if you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs.
