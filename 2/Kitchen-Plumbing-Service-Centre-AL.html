<p>RT Plumbing Services, Inc Cause decreased water pressure and obstructions with their degeneration with time. New disposals are equipped with overload protection. They will shut down instantly if the system clogs, overheats, or becomes overloaded. They consist of a button that allows you to reset the unit to get it working once again. There is typically no additional cost associated with this defense.</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals feature appliance wires attached, and others do not. Remove the cover plate below the disposal and connect the wires according the maker's instructions if yours does not. Many basic disposals have you connect white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. Screw the cover plate back on when you're finished.</p>

Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
