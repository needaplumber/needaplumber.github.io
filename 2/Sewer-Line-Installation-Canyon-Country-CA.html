<p>Once a large enough source of water has been identified and evaluated, the 3rd significant part of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most big cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and diverse sources.</p>
