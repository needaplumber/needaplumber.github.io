If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>In fact, reverse flow testing developed to guarantee that backflow preventers avoid backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow stays a legitimate health issue, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will make sure that backflow preventers are appropriately evaluated by certified personnel.</p>
