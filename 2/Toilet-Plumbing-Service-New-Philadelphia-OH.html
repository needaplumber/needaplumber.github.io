<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>If you have a dishwasher, or want to get one down the line, then make sure the garbage disposal you put in has an accessory for this. This is an ideal variation as waste from the dishwasher can clean directly into the disposal system. Even if you do not have need for a dishwasher, if your house ever changes hands, new owners might value the choice.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
