<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
