<p>The Required Inspections Table shown below lists those inspections that need to be performed to confirm that your work abides by the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. Please note that Virginia's Building regulations prohibits using any plumbing fixtures or equipment prior to approval of all required inspections. We hope this list is helpful to you throughout the course of your project.

Structure, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Security work require extra licenses and inspections. Different notifications are available to explain the inspections required for each kind of permit.</p>
<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you have actually discovered the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are ready to connect your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter has actually been in the drain cleaning business considering that 1935, when Samuel Blanc patented the first electric drain cleaning machine and established the very first Roto-Rooter franchise. Today, the technology hasn't altered much from Blanc's timeless creation, and utilizes blades to cut through debris to restore correct water flow.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by correcting it. Naturally, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
