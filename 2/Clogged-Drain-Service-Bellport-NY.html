<p>Difficult water use may impact the performance of household appliances. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with big accumulations of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits likewise build up to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, thus affecting their performance.</p>
