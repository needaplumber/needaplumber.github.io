<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the standard plumber's putty as laid out below.

<p>Installing the new drain is a simple matter: First, produce a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top. Then install the top half of the drain from the top, and screw the nut and installing bracket on from below. Make certain to eliminate any excess plumber's putty using a putty knife.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
