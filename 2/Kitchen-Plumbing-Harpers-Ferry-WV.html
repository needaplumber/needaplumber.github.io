If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
