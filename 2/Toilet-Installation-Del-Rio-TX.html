<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, commonly known as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the different jurisdictions within the State; minimize the structure's energy and water usage; lower waste; and reduce the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>

While NFPA recognizes that backflow stays a genuine health concern, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are properly tested by qualified workers.</p>
