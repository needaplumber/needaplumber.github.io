<p>Next, check the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again crucial for the repair technician to be aware of the firmness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not harmful. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale development or deterioration. It is important that the repair specialist is sensitive to the solidity and type of the various coverings utilized on iron body units so as not to harm the protective coating.</p>
