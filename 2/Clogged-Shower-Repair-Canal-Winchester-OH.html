<p>Our licensed plumbing specialists can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank need to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may offer a fast fix in the short-term, it can trigger even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

Understanding the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
