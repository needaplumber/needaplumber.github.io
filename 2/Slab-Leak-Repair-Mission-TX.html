<p>If you desire it to work well for years to come, your garbage disposal installation needs to be carried out by a professional plumber. It is a reasonably simple device that draws food scraps down into a barbed mill ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. When they are small enough, they travel through to the remainder of the wastewater to be dealt with. It typically uses up your kitchen sink drain but can be installed on just one side if you have a battle drain setup.</p>
<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were fantastic. They quickly found the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, similar to each person we've encountered with Plumb Crazy, were polite, prompt, and very knowledgeable. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either big or little task plumbing work.</p>
<p>The EcoWater Compact Series Water Softening System is a compact single tank cabinet" style softener, making it a reliable and convenient  system for your house. Friendly, educated technician. He got our drain cleaned out in a very efficient and professional  way. I would not think twice to call Roto-Rooter for any future needs. Toilet Runs Intermittently - Do not you dislike it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It normally suggests there is a problem with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water somewhere.</p>
