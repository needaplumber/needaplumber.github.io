<p>As an entrepreneur, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a destructive result on your company. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience much more tear and wear than residential drains and are more prone to clogs and obstruction. All backflow preventers should be evaluated every year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report need to be provided to us.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any circumstance that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on properties change that may require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your organisation, they can trigger financial losses and in some instances can stop your business entirely. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a little office the concerns brought on by even little drain problems can cause significant problems.</p>
<p>Do you presume that your pipes need to be changed? Call (847) 239-5771 to have your plumbing inspected. Backflow from fire security systems can threaten the security of drinkable water. Understanding how backflow preventers work and why they are essential in a home or business helps homeowner avoid preventable accidents-- and fulfill code requirements in their area.</p>
