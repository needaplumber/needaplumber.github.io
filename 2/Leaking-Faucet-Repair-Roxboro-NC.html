<p>This is another combination that can deal with sink obstructions. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the very first time, you can repeat this procedure.

They, just like everyone we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and extremely well-informed. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either little or big task plumbing work.</p>
