The exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anybody who inhales it requires immediate medical attention.

To avoid this catastrophe, make certain to use your gas ranges exactly as advised and never to use them to warm your house. The exact same chooses portable gas ranges, which are to be used outdoors only and not indoors. When running the space-heaters, make certain someone is awake to monitor them.
