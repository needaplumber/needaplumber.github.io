Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most large cities need several aqueducts providing water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>
