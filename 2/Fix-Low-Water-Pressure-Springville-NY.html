<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
