<p>Weird Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to pass through. Since of the tight space, the pipes frequently make unusual gurgling noises as water attempts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the strange noises originating from your sink.</p>

This method works best for clearing out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as sinks and showers.
