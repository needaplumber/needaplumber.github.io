When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing significant and frequent leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the more affordable and much better long-lasting solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
