<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems need backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be gotten rid of. Backflow assemblies are needed to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law also needs backflow assemblies in commercial establishments such as mortuaries and medical facilities, as well as industrial centers.</p>

Note: Batch-feed disposers do not need a switch since they begin when you insert and turn an unique drain plug.
