<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and fulfill our rigid trust certification standards. A great guideline is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and corroded parts make repairs difficult and costly, indicating a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for concerns such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
