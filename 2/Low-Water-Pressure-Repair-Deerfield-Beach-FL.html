<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet in the Kitchen in Deerfield Beach FL 33442</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
