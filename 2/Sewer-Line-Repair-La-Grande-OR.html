<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
