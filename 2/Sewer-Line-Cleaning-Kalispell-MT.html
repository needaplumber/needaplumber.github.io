A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.

Continuous feed disposals are easy to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.
