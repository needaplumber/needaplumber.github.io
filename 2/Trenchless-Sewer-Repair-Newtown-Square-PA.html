<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>106.11.4.2 Written Test. The applicant shall be needed to pass a composed test appropriate to the proposed plumbing work.

The candidate shall be allowed to re-take the composed test one time, if it is failed.</p>
