This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.
