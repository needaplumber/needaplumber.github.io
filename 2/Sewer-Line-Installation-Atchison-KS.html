<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you've discovered the trip lever you want eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
