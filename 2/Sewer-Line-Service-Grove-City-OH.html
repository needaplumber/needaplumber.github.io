<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to remove chloride.

In houses with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more fragile and prone to splitting, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are prone to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected.

And these differences dictate the prospective need for backflow preventers.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is very important that only initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
