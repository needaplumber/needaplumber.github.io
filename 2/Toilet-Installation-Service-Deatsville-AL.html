It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.
