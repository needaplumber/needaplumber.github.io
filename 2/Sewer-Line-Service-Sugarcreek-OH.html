<p>Find the ideal water softener for you. One common method for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread out exponentially if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
