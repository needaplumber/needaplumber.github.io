<p>No other room in a house includes as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Search for quality products when replacing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to versatile rubber traps. Debris can easily catch in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not provide necessary assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a great option s they can be quickly connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are safe, but in time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly limit the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
