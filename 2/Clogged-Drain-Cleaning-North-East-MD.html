<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in North East MD 21901</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with negative pressure, it actually presses into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
