<p>Depending upon the degree of the clog, we may use a variety of various methods, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative type of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to totally clear out whatever inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and get rid of wire adapters. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp connector and eliminate wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
