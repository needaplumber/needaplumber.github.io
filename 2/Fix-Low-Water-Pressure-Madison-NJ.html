<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leaks are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Inspect to make certain it's not your garbage disposal that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to make sure it's running properly. You might need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the system beneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
