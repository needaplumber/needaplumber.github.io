<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating.
