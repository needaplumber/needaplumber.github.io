If you are going to remodel it is a great time to repipe prior to you paint or complete your walls.  It is essential to understand the scope of the project before work is started. If you notice a separated leak or a little part of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are worn away or broken, it is rather potentially an indication of a bigger issue.</p>
