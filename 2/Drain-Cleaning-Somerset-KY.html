<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an effectively operating RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage needs to likewise be offered.</p>
