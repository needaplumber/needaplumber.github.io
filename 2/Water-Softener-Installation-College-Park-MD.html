Please note that Virginia's Building Code restricts making use of any plumbing components or equipment prior to approval of all needed inspections.

<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As difficult water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause hard water stick to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>The concern of leakage can be attributed to any variety of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank must have some room to represent the expansion that occurs when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to assist manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the growth taking place when boiling the water triggers the tank to crack and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit should use a grounded electrical outlet for power. Already purchased your heater and just need it installed?
