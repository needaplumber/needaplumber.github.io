Roll plumber's putty in between your hands into a rope the size of a pencil and cover it around the lip of the kitchen sink drain opening. Press the kitchen sink strainer securely down into the putty, include the rubber gasket, friction ring and locknut under the sink, and retighten the locknut.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.
