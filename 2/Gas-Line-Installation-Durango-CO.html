<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Durango CO</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper may need somewhat various steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job.

You might not discover a similar match, however possibilities are you'll find one of the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
