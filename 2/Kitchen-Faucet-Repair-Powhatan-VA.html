<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Powhatan VA</h3>
<p>No warm water-- The absence of warm water is the greatest sign that there is something wrong with your San Antonio hot water heater. If you aren't getting adequate hot water for your shower, then you might have sediment that has actually built up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source. It's time to consult the professionals if your water heater isn't doing its only job.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might need a little different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but chances are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
