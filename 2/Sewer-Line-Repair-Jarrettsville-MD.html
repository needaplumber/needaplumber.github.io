Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The law also needs yearly testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report sent to the DEP. Failure to comply can result in charges and termination of water service. Due to the fact that backflow preventer devices are comprised of moving springs, parts, and seals and are subject to destructive compounds, wear, and fatigue, it's vital to correctly keep them to ensure they correctly run and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
