Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
