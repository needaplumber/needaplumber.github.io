<p>A water softener is composed of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It gathers solidity minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are frequently utilized for water softening.

The outcome of our sophisticated water softener technology is healthier, smoother water for you and your household, while still keeping an efficient flow rate.</p>
