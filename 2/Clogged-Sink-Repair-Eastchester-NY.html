<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Eastchester NY</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
