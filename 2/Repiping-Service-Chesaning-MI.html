This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
