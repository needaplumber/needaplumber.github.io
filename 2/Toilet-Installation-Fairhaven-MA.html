<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
