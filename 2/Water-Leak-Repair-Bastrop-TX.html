<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Bastrop TX</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service might seem like a waste of money. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners might be an economical solution, the harsh ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, in time, developing weak spots in the pipe that are likely to rupture. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The extremely hazardous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company staff member had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external house hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through your home into the water supply.</p>
