<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is necessary to the security of your employees and customers. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do it all. Move the brand-new hot water heater into location, recut or extend the old tubing to satisfy the new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings. If the tubing doesn't line up, balance out the lines as needed with sets of 45-degree elbows.</p>
<p>Sewage systems, drains and waste piping are checked for correct grading to keep down flow. The plumbing system is evaluated for leaks. We check that the material used in the plumbing system is authorized by a recognized testing laboratory. We forbid cross connections between safe water and water from a questionable source and prohibit the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We also examine the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>

Secondary backflow techniques offer an increased level of protection for the public water supply system.</p>
