<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
