<p>Pressure Vacuum Breaker. You will need to obtain the maker's pressure loss info for the pressure vacuum breaker you plan to use.

<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning appropriately. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality. If a repipe in Brenham is right for you, call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing examined and we will let you know.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
