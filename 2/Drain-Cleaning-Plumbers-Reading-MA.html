<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have actually attained a development in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) innovation.

The pre-programmed number represents the amount of time in between each regeneration. For instance, a lower chosen number means your softener will restore less frequently.
