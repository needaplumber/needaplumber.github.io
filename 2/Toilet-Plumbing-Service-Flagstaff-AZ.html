<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are safe, but with time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable service, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
