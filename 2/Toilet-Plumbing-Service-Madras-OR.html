<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts.

If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener.
