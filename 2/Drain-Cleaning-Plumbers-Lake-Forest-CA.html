In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in residences were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
