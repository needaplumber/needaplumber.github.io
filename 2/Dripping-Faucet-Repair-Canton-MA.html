<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is also works as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Inspector for the group. Howard, the Job Supervisor, has actually constantly been handy and helpful regarding all our concerns. He did the proposition and scheduled the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair immediately. It is always a pleasure to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line. He is always enjoyable, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>

<p>RT Plumbing Services, Inc Trigger lowered water pressure and blockages with their wear and tear gradually. New disposals are geared up with overload protection.

There is typically no additional cost associated with this protection.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
