<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner set. The total repair bill may remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the new heater.</p>
