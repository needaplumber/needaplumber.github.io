<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>

Channeling takes place when the inbound difficult water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
