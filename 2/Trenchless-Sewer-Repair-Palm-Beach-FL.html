<p>This is another combination that can work on sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this procedure if it does not work the first time.

It is more likely to be discovered in older homes constructed prior to the 1970s.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure.

I would certainly advise them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>Current Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the appointed time period. They disconnected the sinks, tidied up and recommended a tool to be used in the future. How do you know if it's time to call for sewer line repair or replacement? Look out for multiple clogged drains in your house, overflowing or backed up toilets, or water stains on your walls and foundation.</p>
