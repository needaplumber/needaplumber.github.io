<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Alpine UT 84004</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
