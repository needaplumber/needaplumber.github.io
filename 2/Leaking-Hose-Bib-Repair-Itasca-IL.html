<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
