In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs.

Constant blockages indicate your toilet no longer has the power needed to successfully eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
<p>They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I give the company props for calling to update us on the later arrival time.
