<p>You can also depend upon water softeners to reduce your daily operating expense by conserving detergent and allowing you to utilize lower water temperature levels while maintaining a high-quality wash. Water solidity, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, varies across the U.S. from somewhat hard (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Upon earning a high school diploma or GED, potential plumbing contractors need to begin a plumbing apprenticeship. Apprentice programs are the most common way for plumbers to learn the skills required to become successful in the trade. Most apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor companies. Programs typically last 4 to five years and require apprentices to complete a particular number of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
