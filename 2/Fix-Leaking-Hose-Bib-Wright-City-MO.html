Instead of removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it in fact pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is happening.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists force it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
