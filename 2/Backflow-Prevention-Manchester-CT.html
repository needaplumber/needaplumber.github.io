<p>As with other building employees, work of pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers is delicate to changes in the economy.

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some clogs. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
