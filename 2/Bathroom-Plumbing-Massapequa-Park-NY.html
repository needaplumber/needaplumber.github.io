<p>Plastic pipe remains in broad usage for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century however did not become practical to make till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a technique to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and was in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
