<p>Every toilet clogs from time to time. How often a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush. If your toilet clogs more than once a month-or even as soon as a week!- it's probably since mineral deposits have developed around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>

The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will trigger your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your house starts to show any of these indications of rust, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system.</p>
