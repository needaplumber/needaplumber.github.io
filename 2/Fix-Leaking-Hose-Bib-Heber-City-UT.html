There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that might result in incorrect information on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause severe pressure spikes that might harm components. The impacts of elevated temperature level can also trigger excessive pressure conditions which might harm the parts in the elements.
