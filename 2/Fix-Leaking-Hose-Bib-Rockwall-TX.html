<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, but steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
