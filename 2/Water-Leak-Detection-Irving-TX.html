<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The need upstream could cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
