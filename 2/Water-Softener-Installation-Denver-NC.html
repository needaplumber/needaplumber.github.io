That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
