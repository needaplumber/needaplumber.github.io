<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
