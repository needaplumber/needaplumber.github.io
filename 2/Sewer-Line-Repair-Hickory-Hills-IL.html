<p>Your disposer may include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as outlined listed below. Both will produce a good seal (though the gasket might result in small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of choice.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
