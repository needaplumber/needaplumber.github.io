<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
