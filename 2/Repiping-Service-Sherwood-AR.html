Water temperature concerns can be repaired by adjusting the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>

<p>It doesn't always mean they need to be replaced if your pipes are older than these standards. Well-maintained pipes might last longer, and poorly kept ones or those in areas with tough water (meaning it has high mineral content), might fail sooner, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the life-span estimates.</p>
