<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
