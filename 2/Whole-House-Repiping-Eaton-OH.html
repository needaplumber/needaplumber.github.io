<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
<p>DCVs are specifically created to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The essential for typical fire protection applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 independently operating spring-loaded check valves (generally inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade waste disposal unit start around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending upon size, brand and functions.</p>
