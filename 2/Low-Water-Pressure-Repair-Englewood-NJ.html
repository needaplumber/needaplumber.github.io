<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, typically referred to as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to attain consistency among the various jurisdictions within the State; decrease the structure's energy and water usage; lower waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are easy to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can often get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>Once you've found the trip lever you desire, all you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Remember that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct way. When you've secured the journey lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home.
