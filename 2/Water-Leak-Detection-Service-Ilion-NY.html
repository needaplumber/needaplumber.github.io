<p>We need to clarify a little terms before we continue with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut down, properly located test dicks, and the required parts of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet).

A part can further be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make components, and parts are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>In order to insure the correct operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it should be evaluated and certified upon installation and a minimum of once a year thereafter if installed to secure form a health danger situation. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water providers manage these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear, or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be checked periodically to ensure that they are working effectively. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked with correctly calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
