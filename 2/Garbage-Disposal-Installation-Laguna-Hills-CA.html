<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system.
