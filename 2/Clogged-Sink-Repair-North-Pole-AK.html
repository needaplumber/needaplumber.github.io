<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor North Pole AK</h3>
<p>When we manage your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair, you can unwind and utilize your gas piping with no concern. While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's likewise a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
