Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
