<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does happen more often than you think! When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
