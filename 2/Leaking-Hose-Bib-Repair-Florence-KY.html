<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>

<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Florence KY 41042</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>If additional renovations are desired, such as setting up a tankless water heater or broadening the water supply to accommodate a remodel, this is when those extra modifications will be made. Finally, the drywall and other materials will be fixed, covered, and retextured so that it appears like nothing ever happened. Polyvinylchloride pipes or PVC pipes are frequently used for the main water system to your house along with the home sinks, toilet, and bathtub drain lines or vent stacks. Due to the strengths of PVC, it is one of the most widely used plastics on the planet.</p>
