We are now ready to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some models require the components to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each component is returned into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the right location. It is also crucial that as they are placed back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the components or accidentally put in the body. The elements need to be put so that the guides are able to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>
<p>Whether you're redesigning your bathroom or simply upgrading old components, changing a toilet can be a big job if you have actually never done it in the past.
