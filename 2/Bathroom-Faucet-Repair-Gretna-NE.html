<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You may be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, but without the zinc finish.

This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again crucial for the repair specialist to be aware of the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not damaging. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to reduce any scale development or rust. It is necessary that the repair technician is sensitive to the firmness and type of the various coatings utilized on iron body units so as not to harm the protective coating.</p>
