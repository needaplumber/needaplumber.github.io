<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very important part of the style of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
