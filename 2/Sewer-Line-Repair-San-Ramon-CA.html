<p>No other room in a house consists of as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, in addition to flexible rubber traps. Debris can quickly catch in this type of piping while the piping's versatile nature does not provide required assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a great option s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
