<p>This short article aims to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few confusing truths that frequently lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is generally destructive. Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
