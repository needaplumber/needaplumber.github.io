<p>Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed appropriately. A hot water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is launched, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
