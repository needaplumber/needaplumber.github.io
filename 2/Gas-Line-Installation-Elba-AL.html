<p>In water system systems, water is typically preserved at a considerable pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or stop working reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened).
