PVC assemblies are a good option s they can be quickly connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
<p>Repair leaky eves that might leak water onto the meter and freeze. Garbage disposal units work because they shred food waste into pieces little enough to pass through plumbing.
