Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
