<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly should then be assessed. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that might lead to incorrect data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to severe pressure spikes that might harm components. The effects of raised temperature can also cause extreme pressure conditions which could damage the parts in the elements. These and other negative impacts from the hydraulic conditions should be recognized and their cause fixed. If parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not fixed, the new parts can quickly be made inoperative.</p>
