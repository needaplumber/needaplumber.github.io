Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really important part of the style of each element. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
