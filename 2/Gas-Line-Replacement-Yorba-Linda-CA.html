<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Yorba Linda CA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the help of a professional. Some small obstructions can be taken care of with a plunger and often, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a simple matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, certain problems do call for a skilled plumber, and it is very important to know the distinction to avoid wasted frustration, time, and money.</p>
