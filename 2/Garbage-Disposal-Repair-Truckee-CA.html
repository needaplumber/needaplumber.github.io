<p>Tough water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
