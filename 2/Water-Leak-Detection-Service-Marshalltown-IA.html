<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to assist prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and harden or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in great shape.</p>
