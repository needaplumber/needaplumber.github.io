<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
