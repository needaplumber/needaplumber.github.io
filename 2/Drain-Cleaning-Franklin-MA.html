<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
