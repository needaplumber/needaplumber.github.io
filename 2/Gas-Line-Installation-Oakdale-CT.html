<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Oakdale CT</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
