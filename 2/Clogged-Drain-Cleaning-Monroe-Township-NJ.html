<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Monroe Township NJ</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to make sure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
