<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Common enough that lots of people go for diy repairs. But sometimes even identifying the leak can be an issue.

<p>While a DIY toilet replacement is definitely possible, it's also easy to screw up. And when you screw up a toilet installation, you can wind up with huge problems: Leakages, destroyed floorings, moisture in floor substructures and walls-- pricey and major concerns. Unless you're really skilled, it's best to rely on a professional for changing a toilet.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
