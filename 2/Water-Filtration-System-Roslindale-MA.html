This can cause low circulation problems and even stop a component from flowing entirely. The next typical concern that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it decreases the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
