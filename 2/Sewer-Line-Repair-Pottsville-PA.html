<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Pottsville PA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
