<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
