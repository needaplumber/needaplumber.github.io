<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by safeguarding your water-using equipment from bad performance and premature failure. Some tough water problems are extremely visible, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged.

Noticeable or invisible, these problems have actually genuine costs related to them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or reconditioning costs and can frustrate your clients. Scale accumulation in your hot water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses. Quickly, these little expenses can amount to make a genuine influence on your bottom line.</p>

Here are a few complicated facts that typically lead people to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is usually destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a misconception since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
