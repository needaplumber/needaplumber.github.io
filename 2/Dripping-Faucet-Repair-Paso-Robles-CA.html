At the least, it would have been a really pricey alternative.</p>
<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. With time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
