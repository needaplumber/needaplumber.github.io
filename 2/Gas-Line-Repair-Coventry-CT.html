<h3>Faucet Repair in Coventry Connecticut</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have attained a development in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface area Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) innovation. SACr physically eliminates momentary solidity without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant limitations of current softening innovations.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
