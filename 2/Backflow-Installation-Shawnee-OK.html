<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is showing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes.

Without consistent testing and servicing, these systems can enable infected water to flow freely within your supply pipes, developing a serious health danger to developing occupants.
