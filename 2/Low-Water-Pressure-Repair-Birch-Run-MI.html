<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Birch Run MI</h3>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
