For double-bowl sinks, the very best way to go about things is to use a continuous waste disposer set consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such sets direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the place of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet kit.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by correcting it.

If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
