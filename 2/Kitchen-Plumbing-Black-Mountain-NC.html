<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if essential.

You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
