<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive option.</p>
