<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, however steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
