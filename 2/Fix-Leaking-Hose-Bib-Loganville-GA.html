<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Loganville GA</h3>
<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the external coating of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden pipes: The highly hazardous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company worker had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external home hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through the house into the water system.</p>
