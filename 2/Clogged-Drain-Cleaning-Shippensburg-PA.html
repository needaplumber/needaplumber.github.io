<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from rust and might put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your home. This might not need completely repiping the house, since newer products may have already been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you determine precisely what work requires to be done.</p>
