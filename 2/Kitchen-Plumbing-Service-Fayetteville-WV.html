When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water.

Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
