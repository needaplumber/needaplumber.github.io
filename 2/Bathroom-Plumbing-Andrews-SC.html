The system filters out these difficult water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing when water streams through a Water Softener. State certified backflow professionals, readily available through your grass irrigation company or plumber can identify whether your equipment meets the requirements. The policies likewise require a state certified backflow specialist test the backflow preventer annually.</p>
