<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure.

A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
