<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dosage, water solidity, and washing temperature to see if solidity had an effect on detergent savings. The study included tests that got rid of tough soils, in addition to examining shooting and spotting. Scientists found that softened water utilizes practically 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg hardness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent savings increases to nearly 70%.</p>
