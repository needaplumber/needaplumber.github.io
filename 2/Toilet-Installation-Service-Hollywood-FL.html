This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
