Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
