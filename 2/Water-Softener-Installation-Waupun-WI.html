<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water system and personal on-site water supply and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections in between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of defense for the public supply of water system.</p>
