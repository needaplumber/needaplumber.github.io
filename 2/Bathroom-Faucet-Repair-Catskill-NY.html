When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced with time.
