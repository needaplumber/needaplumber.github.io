<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. The water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to get away, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the expansion occurring when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
