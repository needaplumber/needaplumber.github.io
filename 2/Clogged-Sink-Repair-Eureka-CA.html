<p>In the 1990 ′ s, dry spell conditions determined water service providers to implement water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
