<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
