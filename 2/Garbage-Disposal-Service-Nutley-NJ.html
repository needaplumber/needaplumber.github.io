<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
