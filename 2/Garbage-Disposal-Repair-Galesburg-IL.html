<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
