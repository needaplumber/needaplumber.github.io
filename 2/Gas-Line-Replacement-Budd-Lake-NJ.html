Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
