Rates depend on the precise repair required, where you live, employing a plumber vs. employing a handyman, and whether or not you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Sewage systems, drains and waste piping are checked for appropriate grading to maintain downward flow. The plumbing system is tested for leakages.

We also inspect the vent pipes to balance the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
