<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Things such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can end up being lodged in between your drain and your pipes. These will ultimately obstruct the flow of your water prior to triggering a clog. Also, if too much toilet paper is flushed down your toilet, or sanitary products are flushed, a clog can take place.
