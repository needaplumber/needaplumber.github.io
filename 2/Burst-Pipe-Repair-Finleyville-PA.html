<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, however without the zinc finishing. The zinc finishing on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with moisture. While it does its job pretty well, over time, it still does corrode. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>

In many cases, elimination will only include an extra $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, but in some cases the expenses might be greater if extra pipes need to also be replaced.</p>
