While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>. The size of the population likewise affects water need. According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The median per capita water utilize each day is higher in rural counties than urban counties in all the environment areas, except in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with backwoods having less efficient supply of water systems2 mainly due to the relative absence of financial resources to update and keep their systems. So, the higher per capita usage" of water in backwoods might include considerable non-revenue water losses from their distribution pipelines. Such concerns also factor into the need for backflow preventers at the points of usage.</p>
