Storage tank hot water heater are generally the least pricey systems.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
