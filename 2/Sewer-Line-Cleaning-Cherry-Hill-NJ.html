<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Cherry Hill NJ</h3>
<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
