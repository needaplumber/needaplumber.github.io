<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Hohenwald TN</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is capacity for the polluted water to become a health danger if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
