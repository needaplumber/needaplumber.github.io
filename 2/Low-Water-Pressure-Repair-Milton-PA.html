<p>Changing your flapper may require a little different steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll find among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
