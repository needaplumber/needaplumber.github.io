It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed over time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely broken and just needs to be replaced.</p>
