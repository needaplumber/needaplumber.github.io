<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
