If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however possibilities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
