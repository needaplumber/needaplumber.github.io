<p>Leaks are sneaky. You may need to pay for the installation of electrical circuitry if there is no grounded outlet present to power the garbage disposal. The cost of products for a grounded outlet will likely cost between $5 and $10, and $120 to $165 to employ an electrical contractor If your installation needs a brand-new switch, expect to invest an additional $5 to $10 on products, and $50 for labor.</p>
