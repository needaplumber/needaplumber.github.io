Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to destroy micro-organisms and supply cleansed water. The cost is roughly the very same for installing a lp gas line from the tank to your home as the cost to have gas run to your home. Find out which type of gas your house currently has. Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>In a busy household, a clogged bathtub drain can become a big problem over night. Soap, hair, animal fur, and even bath toys can contribute to clogged bathtub drains. With the correct plunger or drain snake, it's possible to unclog a bathtub drain by yourself. If you can't recognize the location of the clog or quickly remove it yourself, Roto-Rooter plumbers bring all the tools of the trade necessary to get your clogged bathtub drain back in service once again.</p>

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET used by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
