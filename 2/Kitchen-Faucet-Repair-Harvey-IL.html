<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of security. The device permits water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the building, but closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect method.

<p>Yes, we've all been there, when the toilet obstructions and we're left feeling defenseless without the power to flush! A clog normally involves increasing water, followed by panic and plunging.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
