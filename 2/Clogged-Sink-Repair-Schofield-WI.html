Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess.

<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer needs lots of items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be assessed. The installation should be evaluated to ensure it does not prevent the functions of the assembly. Test data must be built up to determine the workings of each part. The backflow prevention assembly should be dismantled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be checked again to be sure it was properly fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the producers flowchart is needed to ensure it was repaired correctly. A properly repaired assembly needs to provide years of defense.</p>
