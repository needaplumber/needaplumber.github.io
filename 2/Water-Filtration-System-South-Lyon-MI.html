<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
