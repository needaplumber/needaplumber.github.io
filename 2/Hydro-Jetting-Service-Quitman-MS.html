<p>Replacing your flapper might require somewhat different steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, however chances are you'll find among the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
