<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Northport NY 11768?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
