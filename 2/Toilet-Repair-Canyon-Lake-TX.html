When choosing a plumbing company to manage your Los Angeles repiping project, you want to make sure that the contractor you pick is honest, experienced, and geared up to deal with the task.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Dealing with a leaky faucet or sputtery waste disposal unit is never ever enjoyable, but putting off fixing it for too long can trigger water damage or increase your water bill.
