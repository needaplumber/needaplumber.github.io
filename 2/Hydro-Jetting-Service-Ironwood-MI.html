<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Ironwood MI</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a quote as soon as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
