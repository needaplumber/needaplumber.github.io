<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

Accuracy Today Plumbing Drain Cleaning focuses on tankless water heater installation throughout Wheaton and the surrounding locations.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
