<p>First and foremost, never ever plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your house to the city line.) You might have an idea of where your lateral is situated if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not know, invest the very little cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or perhaps dig into and break the line. If you are hiring somebody to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also know the locations to prevent. If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to recognize.</p>
