<p>Tankless electrical water heaters come in two types. There are whole-house heaters that are effective and big enough to provide hot water to all bathrooms, cooking areas, and home appliances in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electrical heaters that supply warm water to specific spaces or appliances only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the same way. The only difference is the amount of water they can warm up at any offered time. Likewise, whole-house systems are substantially more expensive than the point of usage units.</p>
