<p>When a big sufficient source of water has actually been determined and evaluated, the third major part of a supply of water system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. The majority of big cities need several aqueducts supplying water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
