Some parts may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
