<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to ensure it works. Inspect below to be sure there aren't any leakages.
