<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you've discovered the journey lever you want eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
