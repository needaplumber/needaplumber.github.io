<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess. They, just like everyone we have actually encountered with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and extremely knowledgeable. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either big or small task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; obtain the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
