<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Corpus Christi TX 78415</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Tip: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I recently had numerous plumbing leakages repaired and couldn't be better with the timely service I got from Parker and Sons. They are really educated, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would certainly recommend them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
