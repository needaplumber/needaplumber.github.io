<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Oak Hill WV 25901</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
