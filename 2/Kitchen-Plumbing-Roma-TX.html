<p>In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to eliminate small sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending on the size of your house, this process will likely take a few days to a week to complete. Don't stress, while we're dealing with your house we'll cover all of your furnishings, floors and other valuables so that our work doesn't make a mess. After the whole process is ended up and your house is tidied up, we'll test to make sure that water is streaming properly through all of your brand-new pipes.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
