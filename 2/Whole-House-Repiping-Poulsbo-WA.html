<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
