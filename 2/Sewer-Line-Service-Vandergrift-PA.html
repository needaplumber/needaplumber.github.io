<p>Replacing your flapper may require somewhat different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To discover a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
