<p>Since 1980, backflow preventers have been lawfully mandated for specific structures by the New York Sanitary Code and the Guidelines of the City of New York City. The policy was not strictly implemented up until a push in recent years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that includes routine random inspections of New York City buildings to make sure they are in compliance.</p>
<p>In truth, reverse flow testing designed to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011.
