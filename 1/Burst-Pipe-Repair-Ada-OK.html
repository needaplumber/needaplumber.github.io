Since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
