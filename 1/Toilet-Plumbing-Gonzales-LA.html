<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

A part can even more be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make elements, and elements are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
