<p>Inspecting the water meter is a terrific next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be major problem. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house must have water. This chooses every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working effectively, you are off to a great start.</p>
