The largest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most large cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
