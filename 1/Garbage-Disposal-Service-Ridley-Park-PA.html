<p>You see rust in your water: If you begin to discover rust in your water, it could be a sign that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. Rust often seeps into the water supply when pipes have actually become corroded. Although rust isn't naturally dangerous for your health, it can be an indicator of problem to come. If you buy a replacement that's made by the same manufacturer as your old model, you might have the ability to bypass the need to replace the waste assembly and mounting flange in the sink, considerably simplifying the job (it can be a larger, more powerful unit-- it just needs to have the exact same mounting flange).</p>
<p>While some problems can just be repaired, others need a full replacement.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
