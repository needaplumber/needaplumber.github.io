Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
