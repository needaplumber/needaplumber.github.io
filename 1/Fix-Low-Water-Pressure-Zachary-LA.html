When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings rises to nearly 70%.</p>

<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were wonderful. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess.

I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone requiring either big or small job plumbing work.</p>
