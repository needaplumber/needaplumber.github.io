Typically, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water until it is in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange procedure to eliminate dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes difficult water.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might need slightly different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however chances are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
