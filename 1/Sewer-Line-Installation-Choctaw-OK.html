You may be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, however without the zinc finishing. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is indicated to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its job pretty well, gradually, it still does wear away.

<p>Difficult water use might impact the performance of household devices. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A big scale accumulation slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with large accumulations of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, thus affecting their efficiency.</p>
