<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is among the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health hazard conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
