<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Breinigsville PA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
