<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be personalized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will check your water to determine the ideal water treatment for your home. Because the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system needs less area. The CareSoft ® system was developed with the exact same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that provides high-performance hardness removal you can depend on for several years to come.</p>
