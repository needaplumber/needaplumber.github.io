<p>If you observe an odor or unpleasant smell coming from your unit, which is not unusual, consider investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can leave. These flanges are extensively offered and easy to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware shops. Turn off the supply of water to your house at the main line. To prevent leakages from springing during the installation procedure, shut down the supply of water to your house. Make sure your hot water heater's water system is turned off, as is the electrical energy going to the system.</p>
