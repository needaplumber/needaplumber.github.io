<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is low-cost and simple. However finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
