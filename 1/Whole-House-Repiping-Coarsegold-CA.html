<p>Leakages are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

Visible or invisible, these problems have actually real expenses connected with them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or refurbishing costs and can irritate your customers.
