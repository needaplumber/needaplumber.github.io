<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your sink, shower or tub. Over time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials gather in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are one of the most common indications that your unit is at the end of its life expectancy, specifically if they are causing significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe due to the fact that the plumber will need to navigate through walls to do the job. Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a huge job - and it's a task you want to get right. But the range of plumbing pipe materials to choose from can make it confusing. Here we look at some of the attributes of the significant pipe types to help you select the right pipe for your plumbing.</p>
<p>Switch on the gas and inspect connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mixture bubbles. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. When finished, clean the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to suggestions that accompanies the photos to make certain the connections are tight.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last permanently. It has remained in location considering that your home was developed so it has to do with the exact same age as your house. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and rust. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
