<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Orland CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
