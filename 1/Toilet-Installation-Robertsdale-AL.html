<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
