<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health risk conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must likewise be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).

<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down.

One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
