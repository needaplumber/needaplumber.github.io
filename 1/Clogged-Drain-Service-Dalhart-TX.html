One way to test for any leaks in your plumbing is to turn off all water appliances in your home and outdoors (sprinklers, tubes, and so on). Then find and see the numbers on your house's water meter. You have a leak if the numbers go up after 20-30 minutes. And the faster those numbers increase, the larger the leak.</p>
