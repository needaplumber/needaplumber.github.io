<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
