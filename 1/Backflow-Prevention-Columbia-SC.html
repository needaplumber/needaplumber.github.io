<p>Leakages are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Inspect to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's causing the problem. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then examine it to make certain it's running correctly. You may need to flip the switch discovered on the side or bottom of the system below the sink if the disposal has actually overheated.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Even if copper is showing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>

Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear in time and it's important that they receivethe very same routine maintenance that your automobile or HVAC system gets to guarantee your family's water is safe & clean.</p>
