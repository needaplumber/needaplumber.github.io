<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
