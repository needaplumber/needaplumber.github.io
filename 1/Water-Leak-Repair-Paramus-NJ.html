<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Paramus NJ 07652</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
