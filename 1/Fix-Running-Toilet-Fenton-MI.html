In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs.

Continuous obstructions suggest your toilet no longer has actually the power needed to effectively remove waste with each flush.</p>

Some minor obstructions can be taken care of with a plunger and typically, when the toilet won't stop running, it's an easy matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, particular issues do call for a trained plumber, and it is essential to know the difference to avoid squandered money, time, and aggravation.</p>
