<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers West Hempstead NY</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
