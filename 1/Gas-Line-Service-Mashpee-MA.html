<p>A recently set up hot water heater should not produce weird noises, but it will start to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things aggravate considerably for families with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement may be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
