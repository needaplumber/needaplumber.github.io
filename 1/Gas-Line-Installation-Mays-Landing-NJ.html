<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
