<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
