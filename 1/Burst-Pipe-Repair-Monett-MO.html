<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does happen more frequently than you believe! When you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
