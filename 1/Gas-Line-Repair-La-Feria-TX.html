<p>Find the right water softener for you. One typical method for a house's water supply to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread tremendously if that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in specific houses, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
