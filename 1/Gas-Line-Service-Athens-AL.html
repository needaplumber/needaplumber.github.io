Repairs are the appropriate fix for issues such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
