<p>Leaks are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
