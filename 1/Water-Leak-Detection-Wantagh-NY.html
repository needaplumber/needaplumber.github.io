<p>No other room in a house contains as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned up and inspected the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the elements to be gotten rid of in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are exposed. As each component is returned into the body, it is essential to put them back in the appropriate location. It is also important that as they are positioned back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the components or accidentally positioned in the body. The components should be placed so that the guides have the ability to maintain their developed tolerances.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally two layers of defense. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is entering the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect method.

There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Since they will be on an accreditation test, I discuss them only.</p>
