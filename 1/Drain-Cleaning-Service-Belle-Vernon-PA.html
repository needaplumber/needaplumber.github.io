<h3>Leaky Faucets in Belle Vernon PA 15012 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had several plumbing leakages repaired and could not be happier with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are very educated, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely recommend them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>

If things need to be customized, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and for that reason the overall expenses.
