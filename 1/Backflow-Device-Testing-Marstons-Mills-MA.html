As tough water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger difficult water stick to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions.
