<p>Distribution pipes shift to even smaller sized private service pipes, bring water to individual houses, home services, stores and buildings. Depending upon demand, these pipes range in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water enters the consumer facility through a water meter that tape-records flow rates and water utilization for billing purposes. Private service pipelines are usually made from plastic, type or lead K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be important.</p>
