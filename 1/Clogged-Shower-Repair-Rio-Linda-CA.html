A gas leak can cause a fire, and even an explosion, or trigger physical stress on the body that leads to headaches, fatigue, lightheadedness, irritation to eyes and throat, chest discomforts, calling in the ears, nosebleeds, and more. In fact, Carbon Monoxide poisoning is a common impact of unattended gas line repair projects. Outside of bodily harm, gas line leakages can also cause extreme damage to your pipes, implying more of your hard-earned money invested in repairs.</p>
