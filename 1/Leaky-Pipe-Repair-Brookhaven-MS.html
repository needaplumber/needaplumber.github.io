<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
