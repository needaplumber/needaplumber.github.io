If you need a brand-new toilet, the cost largely depends on the toilet you pick. Toilets vary in style, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more costly than others. When installing a brand-new toilet, the plumber may also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the task.</p>
<p>The problem of leakage can be attributed to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank must have some room to account for the expansion that happens when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to get away, thus the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force applied by the expansion happening when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to split and begin leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
<p>Though it's not always essential, often the plumber might need to update or repair wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This usually costs an additional $50 to $100+.
