<p>Leakages are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
