<p>Discover the right water softener for you. One typical method for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual residences, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
