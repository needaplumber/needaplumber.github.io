<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place.

Programs generally last 4 to five years and require apprentices to complete a particular number of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
