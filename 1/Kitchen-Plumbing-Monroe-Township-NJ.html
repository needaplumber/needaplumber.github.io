<p>Backflow is bad news.

<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
