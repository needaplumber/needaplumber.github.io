Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
