For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
