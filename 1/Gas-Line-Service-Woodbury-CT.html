Throughout regrowth, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Turn on the gas and inspect connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When ended up, wipe the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work.
