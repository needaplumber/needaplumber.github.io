<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing company.

For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide adequate flow.</p>
<p>In a hectic household, a clogged bathtub drain can become a substantial issue over night. Soap, hair, pet fur, and even bath toys can add to clogged bathtub drains. With the correct plunger or drain snake, it's possible to unclog a bathtub drain by yourself. If you can't determine the area of the clog or easily eliminate it yourself, Roto-Rooter plumbers carry all the tools of the trade essential to get your clogged bathtub drain back in service once again.</p>

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as the majority of plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
