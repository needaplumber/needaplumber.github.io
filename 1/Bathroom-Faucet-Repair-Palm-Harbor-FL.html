<p>Find the ideal water softener for you. One common method for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.

Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water.
