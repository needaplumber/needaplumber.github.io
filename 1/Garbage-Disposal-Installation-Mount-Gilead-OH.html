<p>Changing your flapper might need a little various actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
