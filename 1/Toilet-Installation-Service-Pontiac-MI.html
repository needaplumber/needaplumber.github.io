<p>Difficult water use may impact the efficiency of household devices. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A big scale buildup slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with big build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing components and develop in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, hence impacting their efficiency.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle.
