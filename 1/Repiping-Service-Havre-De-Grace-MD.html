<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
