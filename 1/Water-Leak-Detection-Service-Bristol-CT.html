When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
