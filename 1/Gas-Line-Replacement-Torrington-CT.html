Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does happen more frequently than you think! When you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most common cause of backflow problems.
