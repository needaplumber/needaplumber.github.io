<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Mahomet IL 61853</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
