<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
