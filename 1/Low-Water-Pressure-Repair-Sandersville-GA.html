<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Sandersville GA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
