<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Highland Park MI</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
