<p>Leakages-- Water leaks are another major issue that water heaters can have. Leaks can in fact be a serious scenario.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair bill may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the new heater.</p>
