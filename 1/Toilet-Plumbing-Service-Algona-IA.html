<p>This short article aims to attend to the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an effectively configured water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few complicated realities that often lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is generally destructive. For that reason, softened water must likewise be corrosive, right? This is a misconception since naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Algona IA 50511</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
