<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

Most plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
