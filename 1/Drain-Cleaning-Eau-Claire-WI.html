A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in private homes, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health threat if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
