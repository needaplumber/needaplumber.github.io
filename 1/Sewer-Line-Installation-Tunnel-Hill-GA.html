<p>A freshly set up hot water heater must not produce unusual noises, however it will begin to create rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater goes to heat the water. Things get worse dramatically for households with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
