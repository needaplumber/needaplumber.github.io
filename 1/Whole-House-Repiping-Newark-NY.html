<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly choice.</p>
<p>Examine to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then examine it to make sure it's running properly. If the disposal has overheated, you may need to flip the switch discovered on the side or bottom of the unit below the sink.</p>
