<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
