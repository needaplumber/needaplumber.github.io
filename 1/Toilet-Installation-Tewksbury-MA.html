<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Tewksbury MA 01876</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
