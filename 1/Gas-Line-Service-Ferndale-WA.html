<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of firmness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
