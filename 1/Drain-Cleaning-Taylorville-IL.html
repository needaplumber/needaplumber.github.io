<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. Identify the size of the pipes in the house and around the house - they will assist to determine the water pressure that you'll have.

The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in size to supply sufficient flow.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
