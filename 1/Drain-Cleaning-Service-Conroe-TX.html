After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. But water softeners were produced to combat a remarkably typical issue: difficult water.</p>
<p>Next, acknowledge that unless your water is extremely hard, all the incoming water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry connections most likely must be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. Sometimes, you may prefer to soften the warm water only. Measure the water use at the designated connections for each person in the household or use the following table as a guide.</p>

<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as detailed listed below. Both will produce a good seal (though the gasket might lead to percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to remove.</p>

<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the system falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
