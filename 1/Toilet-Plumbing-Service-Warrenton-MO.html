<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot.

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
