<h3>Gas Line Inspection in Nashville Georgia</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have actually attained a development in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) technology. SACr physically removes short-term hardness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant limitations of existing softening technologies.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
