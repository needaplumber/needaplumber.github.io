The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health threat or health hazard conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
