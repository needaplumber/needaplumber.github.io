<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
