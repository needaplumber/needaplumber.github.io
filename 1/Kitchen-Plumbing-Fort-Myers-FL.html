<p>You might have heard stories about a hot water heater taking off inside a home or organisation! It is very important to understand that a plugged temperature level and pressure relief valve on your hot water heater can turn your water heater into a hazardous time bomb. The age of your water heater. A conventional tank hot water heater normally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last approximately 20 with correct maintenance and care.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
