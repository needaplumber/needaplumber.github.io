<p>Our bathroom and kitchen sinks are something we consider granted up until they begin breaking down. And it just so happens that our bathroom and kitchen sinks start acting up at the most troublesome times, like when we're having over dinner visitors, or when we're running late for work in the morning.

As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
