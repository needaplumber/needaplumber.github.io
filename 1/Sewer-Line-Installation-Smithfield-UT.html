<p>Our Water Softeners Are Brilliantly Designed To Work. Your house's main seamless gutter system collects rainwater from the roofing line and controls its path down your home to ground; but the water could still puddle next to the foundation. That's where underground gutter drains are valuable. They connect to the downspouts on your house and move water away from the foundation underground. Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a process used to clear debris from the side seamless gutter pipes on your house.</p>
