Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
