Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>

The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
