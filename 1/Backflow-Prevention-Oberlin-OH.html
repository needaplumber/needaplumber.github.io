<p>These valves have a lot of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention choices, but they also offer the least amount of defense. A climatic vacuum breaker, likewise referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc increases and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to enable air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
