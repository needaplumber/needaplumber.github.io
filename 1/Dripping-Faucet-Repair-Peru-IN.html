<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
