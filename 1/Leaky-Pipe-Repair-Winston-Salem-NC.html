The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
<p>Deterioration: The most common problem is deterioration in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is specifically real if you have neglected difficult water, which contains severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is causing the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is challenging to repair.
