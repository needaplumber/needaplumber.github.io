<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Whenever you turn on a hot water tap in your home, cold water enters the heater through a pipe.
