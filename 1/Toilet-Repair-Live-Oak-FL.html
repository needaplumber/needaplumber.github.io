<p>Sewer lines have one crucial role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey choice.</p>
<p>In a busy household, a clogged bathtub drain can become a big problem over night. Soap, hair, animal fur, and even bath toys can add to clogged bathtub drains.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
