<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leaks. We discover that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and better long-term option if you do have regular leaks.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet simpler, new toilet bolts are additional long. That implies you have to cut off the protruding ends later on with a hacksaw. But very first link the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and look for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut till you've done these final checks lets you quickly reset the toilet and get rid of if you discover any problems.</p>
