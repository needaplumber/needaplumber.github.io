<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

For this factor, many softeners are not ranked for efficiency, only for convenience features like handiness, size, maintenance requirements, safety and cost. These functions are a matter of personal preference. So be wary of sales people who try to offer you on their item's capability to outlive or "outsoften" other products. Most water softeners are hardware on which you can rely.</p>
