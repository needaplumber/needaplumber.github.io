<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Haiku HI</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
