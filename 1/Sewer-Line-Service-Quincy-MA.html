<p>Inspecting the water meter is a fantastic next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and check if the water meter is turning. There is a leak someplace and this might be major issue if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house ought to have water. This goes for every other shut down valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to an excellent start if everything is working correctly.</p>
<p>Dealing with a leaky faucet or sputtery waste disposal unit is never enjoyable, but postponing repairing it for too long can cause water damage or increase your water expense. Working with a contractor to repair an issue with your sink or faucet as quickly as it starts deserves the cost - especially when your DIY clogged-drain fixes and bolt-tightening efforts no longer work.
