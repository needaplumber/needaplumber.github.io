<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

An extermination company worker had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external house hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through the house into the water supply.</p>
