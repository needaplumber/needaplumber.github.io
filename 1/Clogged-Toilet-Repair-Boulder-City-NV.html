<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
