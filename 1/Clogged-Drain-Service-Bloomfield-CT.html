<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are set up in locations where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>A recently set up water heater need to not produce strange noises, but it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things intensify drastically for families with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be needed.</p>
