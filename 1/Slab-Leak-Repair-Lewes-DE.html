<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If allowed to return to the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
