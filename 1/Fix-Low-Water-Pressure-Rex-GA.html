<p>As an entrepreneur, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a terrible impact on your service. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience much more tear and wear than residential sewage systems and are more vulnerable to blockages and clog.

When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
