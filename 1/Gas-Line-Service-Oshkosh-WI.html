<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream could cause a reversal in flow.</p>
