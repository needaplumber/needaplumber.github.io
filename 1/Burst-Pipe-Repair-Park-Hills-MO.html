<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the professional to precisely examine conditions and detect the functionality of the pipes. The information we obtain from the inspection enables us to make an informed choice relating to the condition of your pipes and advise the best service as well. We can make the perfect suggestion with self-confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin.</p>

If the P-trap under you sink is clogged, it can cause water to build all the method up your drains and develop a leak someplace along the method.

<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; recover the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer.
