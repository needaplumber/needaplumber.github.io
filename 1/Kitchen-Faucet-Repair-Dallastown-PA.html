<p>Responsive flow technology works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
