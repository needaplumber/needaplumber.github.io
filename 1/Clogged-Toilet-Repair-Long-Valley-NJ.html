<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Long Valley NJ 07853</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>

<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is showing does not suggest you do not have polybutylene pipes. You may have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>If you switch on your house's water spigots and water starts draining with a yellowish, brownish or reddish tint, that's a clear sign that rust or sediment has developed in your pipes and a repiping task needs to be in your future.
