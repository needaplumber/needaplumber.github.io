<p>When a big adequate source of water has been determined and evaluated, the 3rd significant part of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers.

Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many large cities need numerous aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>

<p>Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the structure license. Inspections should be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon completion.
