Things intensify significantly for homes with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
