<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

You might have an idea of where your lateral is located if you have had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or even dig into and break the line. If you are employing somebody to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also understand the locations to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to determine.</p>
