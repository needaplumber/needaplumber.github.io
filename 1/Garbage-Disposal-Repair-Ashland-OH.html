<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Ashland OH</h3>

When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
