<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>To become a certified journey level or specialized plumber in Washington, you should generally begin as a plumber trainee Washington has mutual certification with Idaho for journey level plumbers.

Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
