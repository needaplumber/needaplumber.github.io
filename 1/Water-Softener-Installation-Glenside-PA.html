<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. Then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in multiple drains at once in your home. This can happen in numerous areas and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>It is very important to keep roots or other blockages from obstructing a. home's service line. For repairs to a service line backup, look under "Plumbing, Drains & Sewer Cleaning" online.
