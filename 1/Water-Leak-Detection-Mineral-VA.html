An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc rises and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to enable air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>DCVs are specifically created to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems.
