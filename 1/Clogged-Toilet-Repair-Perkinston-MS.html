When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is split, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed gradually. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely cracked and simply needs to be changed.</p>
