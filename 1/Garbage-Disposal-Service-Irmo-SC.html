<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Irmo SC</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their duties break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who handle fundamental repairs (often in emergency situations), and plumbers who focus on remodeling projects and additions.</p>
