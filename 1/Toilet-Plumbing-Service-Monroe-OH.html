<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are set up in locations where water might trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the building license.
