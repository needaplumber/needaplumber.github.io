<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractor in Blacksburg</h2>

<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it could wreak unwanted issues on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most obvious indications of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<h3>The Benefits of Using Professional Drainage Services at Blacksburg VA 24060</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
