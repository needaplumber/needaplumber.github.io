<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Fenton MO</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat various steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
