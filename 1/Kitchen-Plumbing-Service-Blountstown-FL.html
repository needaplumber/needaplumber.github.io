<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
