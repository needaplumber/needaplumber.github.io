<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth learning about garbage disposal installation. Typically, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have actually professional repairs done by a plumber. The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include parts or materials.

<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain.
