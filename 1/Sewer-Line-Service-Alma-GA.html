<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water.

Sufficient drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
<p>This short article intends to address the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few confusing facts that often lead people to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is generally corrosive.
