Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.

<p>A freshly installed hot water heater should not produce strange noises, however it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things worsen significantly for families with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be needed.</p>
