<p>Re-piping is a process of replacing the supply pipes in a residence or business. It is not a short-lived fix or a replacement of short sections of pipe, but a complete replacement of your supply plumbing system. There are numerous reasons you may need to repipe your house or service. Deterioration of pipes might cause low water pressure, rusty colored water, reduced water circulation, or leaks. , if you are going to remodel it is a good time to repipe before you paint or complete your walls.. It is essential to understand the scope of the job prior to work is started. If you see a separated leak or a small part of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are worn away or cracked, it is rather perhaps a sign of a bigger problem.</p>

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
