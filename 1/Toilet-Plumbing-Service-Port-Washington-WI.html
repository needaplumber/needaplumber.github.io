One way to test for any leaks in your plumbing is to turn off all water appliances in the house and outdoors (sprinklers, pipes, and so on). Then find and enjoy the numbers on your house's water meter. If the numbers increase after 20-30 minutes, you have a leak. And the faster those numbers increase, the larger the leak.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
