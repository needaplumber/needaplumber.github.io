<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are set up in areas where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
