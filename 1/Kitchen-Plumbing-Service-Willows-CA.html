<p>Remember that an estimate see does not obligate you to choose that company. If the plumber that comes out offers you the heebie-jeebies or seems fly-by-night, call out the next company. You're looking for a company that you can place on speed dial for any plumbing issue, so it needs to be a company of people that you have a great, strong sensation about.</p>
<p>All you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you've found the journey lever you want eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
