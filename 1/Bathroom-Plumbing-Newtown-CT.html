<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your home. Even if the issue stems with the municipal system, it's still clever to bring in the professionals to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
<p>The heating element is taking longer to heat up the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this specific concern is when you have no hot water flowing in your home. The factors for this can range from leaks, faulty or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the elements might be enough if it is one of the pointed out problems. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place often, then a hot water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
