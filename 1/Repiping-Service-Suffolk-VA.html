<p>Your waste disposal unit installation needs to be carried out by a professional plumber if you want it to work well for many years to come. It is a reasonably basic device that sucks food scraps down into a barbed grinder ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps.

If everything is all set, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time.
