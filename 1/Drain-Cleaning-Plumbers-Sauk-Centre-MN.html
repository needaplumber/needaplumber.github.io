<p>People who write these articles must be thoughtful of the consumer and the professional service provider. Don't do an injustice to these individuals by being so narrow minded in your advice. See all of the possibilities. Then write a well informed short article. When the FutureSoft water softener is installed, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This doesn't mean it's not working. FutureSoft is not adding any sodium to the water and is maintaining the crucial, healthy minerals in your water.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
