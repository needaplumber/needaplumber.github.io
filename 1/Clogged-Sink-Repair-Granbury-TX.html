As the external coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a major consider impacted sewer lines. Tree roots grow in various instructions and can get large triggering intrusion of the lines underground. Another reality is that tree roots try to find water sources and will follow the source leading them straight to sewer lines ultimately growing right into them and causing significant sewer line problems.</p>
