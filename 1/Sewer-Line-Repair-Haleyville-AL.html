We are now prepared to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some models require the elements to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each component is returned into the body, it is essential to put them back in the appropriate place. It is also crucial that as they are put back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the parts or mistakenly placed in the body. The elements should be placed so that the guides are able to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
