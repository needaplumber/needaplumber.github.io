<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten up the drain locknut. Last but not least, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
