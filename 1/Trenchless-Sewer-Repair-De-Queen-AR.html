<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters need to have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and products. Pointer: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are degrading slowly from the inside. In many cases, repiping is your only viable option.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
