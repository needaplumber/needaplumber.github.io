Step the water use at the designated hookups for each individual in the household or use the following table as a guide.</p>

<p>A Pilot Light That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you use a gas hot water heater instead of a system with an electric heating component, there is a great chance your pilot burner has actually gone out. This could be because of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of combustible air, or just a strong breeze. No matter what the concern is, however, your water heater will not be able to function till the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>
<p>Our kitchen and bathroom sinks are something we take for given up until they start acting up. And it so occurs that our kitchen and bathroom sinks start breaking down at the most inconvenient times, like when we're having over dinner visitors, or when we're running late for work in the early morning. If you're aiming to save on energy expenses and would like hot water on demand, consider a tankless hot water heater. These systems need less maintenance and last longer (over twenty years) than the standard hot water heater.</p>
<p>You can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some clogs. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
