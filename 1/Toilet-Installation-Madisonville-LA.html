<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly choice.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. If your toilet is relatively brand-new, you might need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain.
