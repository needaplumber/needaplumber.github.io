<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Easley SC</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If your issue is more associated to scale and mineral build-up, it is essential to be aware that many scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is triggered by hard water. Hard water normally leaves lime and calcium buildup which can end up being rather undesirable. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning techniques will definitely help, we highly recommend you look into installing a water softener to help with your hard water.</p>
