<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the exact same thing, however without the zinc covering. The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, with time, it still does wear away.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
