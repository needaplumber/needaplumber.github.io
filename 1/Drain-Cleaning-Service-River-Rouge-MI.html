<h3>Looking For A Plumber In River Rouge MI</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing interruption service might appear like a waste of cash. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners might be an economical option, the severe components corrode your inner drain pipe, over time, developing weak spots in the pipe that are likely to rupture. Handling repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with most property owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
