<p>The anode rod in your water heater is created to attract corrosion-causing elements in the water, assisting to avoid the steel tank from corroding. The very best way to prevent drain obstructions is to see what you flush. If you take a look at your home's plumbing pipes and see discolorations, staining, flaking, small indentations or rust, your pipes are rusting.

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
