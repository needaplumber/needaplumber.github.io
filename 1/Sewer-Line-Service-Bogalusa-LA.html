<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these little deposits are harmless, but over time they build up and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

During regrowth, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often ends up being destructive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main cause of the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
