<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Bloomingdale GA</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
