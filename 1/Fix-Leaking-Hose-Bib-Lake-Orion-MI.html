<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Lake Orion MI</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>It's essential to be mindful that a lot of scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is triggered by tough water if your issue is more associated to scale and mineral accumulation. Difficult water generally leaves lime and calcium buildup which can become rather unattractive. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning techniques will certainly help, we highly suggest you check out installing a water softener to help with your hard water.</p>
