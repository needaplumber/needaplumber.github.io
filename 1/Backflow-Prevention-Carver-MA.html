<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and replaced with new rubber parts. It is important that only initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
