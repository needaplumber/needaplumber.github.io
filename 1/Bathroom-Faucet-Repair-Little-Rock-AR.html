<p>No other room in a house contains as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Search for quality materials when replacing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, together with flexible rubber traps. Debris can quickly capture in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not supply required support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back since he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
