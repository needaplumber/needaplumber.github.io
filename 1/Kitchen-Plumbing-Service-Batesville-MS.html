<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in various parts of the plumbing system, a lot of commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation problems and even stop a fixture from flowing entirely. The next typical problem that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it decreases the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your home effectively remove big quantities of water and waste. Gradually, dirt, debris, hair, and countless other small particles can get caught and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water might not be able to drain rapidly or efficiently, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up. When this occurs, it might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate.</p>
