<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
