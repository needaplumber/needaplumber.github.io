Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
