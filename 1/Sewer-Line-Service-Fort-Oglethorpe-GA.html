<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a feasible service, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
