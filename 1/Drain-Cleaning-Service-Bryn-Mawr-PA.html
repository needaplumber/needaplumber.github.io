<p>Leak detection is a component of water preservation that counts on highly technical know-how and specialized equipment to identify the place of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and pinpoint the location of those leaks at which noticeable water may or might not have actually appeared. Water temperature problems can be repaired by adjusting the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are safe, but in time they develop and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
