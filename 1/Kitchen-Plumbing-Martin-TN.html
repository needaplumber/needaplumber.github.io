<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the house. Usually, the water system to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
