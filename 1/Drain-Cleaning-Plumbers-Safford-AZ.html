<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Safford AZ</h3>
<p>Is your water bad or stinky tasting? Is the water from your cold water tap warmer than you wish to drink? A water purification system with chiller will provide you with cool, clean, yummy water for each glass. At Bonney Plumbing, we understand the satisfaction of a satisfying drink of water. So, we focus on installation, repair and service of water filtration systems and chillers for any application.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
