<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
