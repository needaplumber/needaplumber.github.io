<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.

<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does take place more frequently than you believe! Typically it occurs at night when you do not see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
