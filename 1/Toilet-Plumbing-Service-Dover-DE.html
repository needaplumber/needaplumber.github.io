The biggest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. The majority of large cities need several aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically apart sources.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.
