<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Moncks Corner SC</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
