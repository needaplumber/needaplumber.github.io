<p>These valves have a lot of flexibility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention alternatives, however they also offer the least amount of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to enable air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and rises off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>You hear water running or leaking in the tank. When water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow occurs. The water streaming backwards from a cross-connection might infect the drinking water system. Lawn watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis are common cross-connection points.
