<p>Current Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up during the designated period. They disconnected the sinks, cleaned up and recommended a tool to be used in the future. How do you know if it's time to call for sewer line repair or replacement? Keep an eye out for multiple clogged drains in your home, overflowing or backed up toilets, or water spots on your walls and structure.</p>
<p>The usual solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
