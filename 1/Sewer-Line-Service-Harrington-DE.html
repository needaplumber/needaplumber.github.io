<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
