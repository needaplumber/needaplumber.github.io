<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can cause a bad smell and taste. When you include a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor free drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are thought about a health threat if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area need to be indicated on construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and then each year.</p>
<p>This veteran Oregon plumbing organisation looks after both commercial and residential plumbing repairs. P-trap. It can trigger water to build all the way up your drains and create a leak somewhere along the method if the P-trap under you sink is clogged.

The contractor should have a valid, up-to-date plumbing license, present insurance, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and currently calibrated test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is needed.</p>
