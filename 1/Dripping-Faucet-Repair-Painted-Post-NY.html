The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and blended with water. , if you plan to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>

Then, a brand-new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is linked to its mount.
