Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
