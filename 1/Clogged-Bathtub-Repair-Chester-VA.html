Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
