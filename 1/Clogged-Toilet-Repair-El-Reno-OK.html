<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in El Reno OK 73036</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>A Pilot Light That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you utilize a gas water heater rather than a system with an electric heating element, there is a great chance your pilot light has actually gone out. This could be because of an issue with your thermocouple, a lack of combustible air, or just a strong breeze. Despite what the concern is, however, your hot water heater will not have the ability to function until the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
