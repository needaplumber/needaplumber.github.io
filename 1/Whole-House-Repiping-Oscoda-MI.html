Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to versatile rubber traps. Particles can easily catch in this kind of piping while the piping's versatile nature does not offer required support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a great choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
