<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device.

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best used in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
