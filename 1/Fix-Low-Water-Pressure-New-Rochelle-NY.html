When you experience obstructions in numerous drains simultaneously in your house, then that normally implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in several areas and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
