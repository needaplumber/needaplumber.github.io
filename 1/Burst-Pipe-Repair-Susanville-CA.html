The problem with this type of plastic piping is it can end up being breakable and break quickly, specifically if your water is chlorinated or chemically treated.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
