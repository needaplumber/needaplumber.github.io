With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you've found the journey lever you desire remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you've secured the journey lever and are ready to link your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
