<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust accreditation requirements.

Repairs are the proper fix for issues such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
