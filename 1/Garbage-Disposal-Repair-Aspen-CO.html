<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates specialist inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the specialist to properly examine conditions and diagnose the functionality of the pipes. The information we glean from the inspection enables us to make an informed decision regarding the condition of your pipes and recommend the best service as well. If the pipe needs to be cleaned up of clogs or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the ideal recommendation with self-confidence.</p>
