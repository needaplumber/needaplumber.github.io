<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite.

The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
