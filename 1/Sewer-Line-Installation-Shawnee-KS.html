<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our rigid trust certification requirements. An excellent rule of thumb is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and wore away parts make repairs costly and challenging, meaning a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the appropriate fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little elements of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>When the flush valve in the tank fails or wears out, another bothersome issue is. If you hear the toilet running constantly or periodically you most likely need the valve or float replaced.  Stopping working to repair a running toilet can result in lost water and a very high water costs. Water in Florida is expensive so don't postpone-- get a running toilet fixed.</p>
