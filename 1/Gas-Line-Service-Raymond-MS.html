<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these little deposits are harmless, but over time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
