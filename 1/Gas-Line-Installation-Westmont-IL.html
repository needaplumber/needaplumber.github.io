<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it might wreak unwanted problems on your residential or commercial property. A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Whether you're renovating your bathroom or just upgrading old fixtures, changing a toilet can be a big job if you have actually never done it in the past.
