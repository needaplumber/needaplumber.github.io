When your drains are clogged, you will probably begin to see gurgling noises, water supporting into your sink or shower, or strange smells. Drain obstructions are caused by wear and tear or an accumulation of things we put down the drain over time and as we understand, they can trigger major plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Because of a concern at the point of installation or because of maintenance, water softeners leakages are primarily triggered. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed gradually. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth processes. A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely split and simply needs to be replaced.</p>
