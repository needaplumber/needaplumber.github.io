<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off.

The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>
