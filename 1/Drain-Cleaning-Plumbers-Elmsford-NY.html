<p>When gas burns incompletely, Carbon monoxide is released. The symptoms are the same as direct exposure to gas leakage.

To avoid this catastrophe, ensure to utilize your gas ranges precisely as advised and never ever to utilize them to heat your house. The very same opts for portable gas ranges, which are to be used outdoors just and not indoors. When running the space-heaters, ensure someone is awake to monitor them. Numerous families die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide gas poisoning overnight. Another preventative measure to take is to never run your generators in enclosed areas.
