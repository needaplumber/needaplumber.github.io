Clogged components trigger replacement or refurbishing expenses and can annoy your clients. Scale accumulation in your water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement costs. Quickly, these little expenses can amount to make a real impact on your bottom line.</p>
