<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your house successfully remove large amounts of water and waste. Over time, dirt, particles, hair, and countless other little particles can get caught and develop in your pipes. Ultimately, the water may not have the ability to drain quickly or effectively, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up. When this occurs, it may be time to contact a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine.</p>
<p>Plumbing Inspection Department provides inspection services for all commercial and commercial structures, and confirms compliance with the plumbing code. Inspections are needed for plumbing systems, which include hygienic, industrial waste, vent systems, and fuel gas systems. These systems are located in a range of occupancies, consisting of, but not limited to, medical facilities, high-rise office buildings, commercial structures, manufacturing, food service facilities, retail and residential structures, process waste plants, and refineries.</p>
<p>Within commercial facilities, DCV and RPZ backflow prevention systems must be inspected, kept, and tested with regularity. Without constant testing and servicing, these systems can allow polluted water to stream freely within your supply pipes, creating a major health danger to building occupants. Each backflow prevention system needs different testing treatments and periods, and demands significant experience and understanding.</p>
