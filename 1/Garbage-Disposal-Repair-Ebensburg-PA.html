<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that should also be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and break or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space along with it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in good shape.</p>
