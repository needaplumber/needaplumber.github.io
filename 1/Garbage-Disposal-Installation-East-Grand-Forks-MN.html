<h3>Plumbing Company Serving East Grand Forks MN</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing interruption service might look like a waste of money. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners may be an affordable service, the harsh active ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, with time, creating vulnerable points in the pipe that are likely to burst. Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Discovering high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your house? Water pressure in the house resembles blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can lead to emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is FAR MORE cost-efficient than mold remediation or replacing floor covering or drywall! So we recommend fixing or installing water pressure regulators to secure your entire home.</p>
