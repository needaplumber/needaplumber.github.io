<p>Sinkholes do not only take place in your backyard, regrettably, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your house's structure, the best you can expect is to find out quickly.

In this case, you'll need expert plumbers in addition to foundation repair experts.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
