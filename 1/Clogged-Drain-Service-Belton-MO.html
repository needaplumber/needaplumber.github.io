<h3>Septic Tank Repair in Belton Missouri</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have accomplished an advancement in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically removes momentary solidity without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are major constraints of current softening technologies.</p>
<p>Regrettably, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>

<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water needs.

The CareSoft ® system was developed with the very same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that provides high-performance solidity elimination you can count on for years to come.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
