<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.
