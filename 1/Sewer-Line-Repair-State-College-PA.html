<p>Many houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
