<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
