It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
