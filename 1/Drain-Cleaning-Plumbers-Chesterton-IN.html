It must also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).

The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
