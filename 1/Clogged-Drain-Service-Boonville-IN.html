<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth learning about waste disposal unit installation. Usually, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The hourly charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not consist of products or parts. Costs depend upon the specific repair required, where you live, working with a plumber vs. employing a handyman, and whether or not you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Examine to ensure it's not your waste disposal unit that's causing the problem. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then examine it to make certain it's running correctly. If the disposal has actually overheated, you might need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the system below the sink.</p>
