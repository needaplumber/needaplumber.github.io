<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Frankfort NY</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if essential. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule.
