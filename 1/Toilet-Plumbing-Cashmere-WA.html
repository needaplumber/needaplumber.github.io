<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it doesn't necessarily mean they need to be replaced. Well-kept pipes might last longer, and improperly preserved ones or those in locations with hard water (implying it has high mineral material), might stop working sooner, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life-span estimates.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to remove high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that trigger tough water. The system filters out these hard water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing when water streams through a Water Softener. State certified backflow technicians, offered through your grass watering company or plumber can determine whether your devices meets the requirements. The policies also require a state certified backflow technician test the backflow preventer yearly.</p>
