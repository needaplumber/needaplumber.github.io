Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
