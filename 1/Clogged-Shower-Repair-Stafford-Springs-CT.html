<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you've discovered the trip lever you want remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate way. When you've protected the journey lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>

Usually, the supply of water to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
