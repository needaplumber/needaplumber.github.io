<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
