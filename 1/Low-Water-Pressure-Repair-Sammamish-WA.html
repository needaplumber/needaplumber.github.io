<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to protect them from water damage and dust during the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only remove as much building product as needed to reach, remove, and get rid of the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. You can set up to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
