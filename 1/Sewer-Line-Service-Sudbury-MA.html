<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your household safe from the potential threats of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
