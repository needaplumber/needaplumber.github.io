<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Benton IL</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
