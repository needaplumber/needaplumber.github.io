<p>Tough water usage may affect the efficiency of household home appliances. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with big build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits likewise accumulate to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, hence affecting their efficiency.</p>
