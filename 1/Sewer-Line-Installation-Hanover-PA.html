<p>Depending upon the level of the clog, we may utilize a variety of different techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced type of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to totally clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire ports. Disconnect garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp port and remove wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested for many years. Initially, there would have been a hot and cold  water line going up to the faucet (generally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Using liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless technicians can cure in-place whole brand-new areas of pipe within your harmed line, through small and even pre-existing entry points.</p>
