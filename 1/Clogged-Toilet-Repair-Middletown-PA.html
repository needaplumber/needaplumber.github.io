No matter what types of repairs, maintenance, or installation services you need, let our Atlanta water heater experts handle the information so that you can get back to normal life with warm water. So-called hard" water is the result of ground water travelling through and liquifying rocks and minerals, which then release calcium and magnesium ions. These dissolved ions provide tough water its qualities.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Sadly, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently ends up being destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time.
