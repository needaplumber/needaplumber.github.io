Bottom line: Hard water can make cosmetic and domestic cleaning products less reliable. This can result in inflamed skin and even a broken washing machine.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
