<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
