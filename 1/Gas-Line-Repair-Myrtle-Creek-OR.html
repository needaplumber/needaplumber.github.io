<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a really important part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
